# Dark-Space

Dark-space is a 2D Game built with the python 3rd party library Pygame.

## How to play?

Once you start the play is to defend his lines and not allow the enemy to get past you. You can move the spaceship horizontally using the left and right navigation keys on your keyboard, then position your ship to shoot the aliens (enemies) with the spacebar key as they try to across your lines. Once they get past you, the game is over.

## Inpsiration

I learnt how to build games with the Pygame library by following several FreeCodeCamp YouTube tutorials. For this project, I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&t=245s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) and then continue to work on the game using some of its logic and png files, then re-implement the game logic with OOP, optimized the rendering methods and added new features.

## Setup

1. Have python 3 installed
2. Download or clone this repository and then run:

```ShellSession
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python dark_space.py
```
